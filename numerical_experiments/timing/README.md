# Timing â€” Numerical Experiments

Measure and analyze runtime of the elastostatic LB solver across sizes/settings.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (project environment).
- bash.

## Run

- From this folder (example):

  ```bash
  bash run_timing_study.sh
  ```

## Outputs

- Timestamped logs (e.g., `log_*.txt`) and CSV results (`results_*.csv`).
- Optional plots generated by plot scripts (e.g., `plotter.py`).

## Adjust

- Edit `run_timing_study.sh` for sizes, steps, repetitions.
- Edit Python scripts to change solver parameters or plotting.

## Notes

- Results are saved in the directory where you launch the script.
