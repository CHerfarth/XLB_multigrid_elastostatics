# Speed of Convergence â€” Numerical Experiments

This folder contains scripts for comparing the predicted LFA convergence speed against actual experimental convergence speed. 

# How to run

- Execute
  ```bash
  bash run_convergence_tester.sh
  ```

## Outputs

- Plots (PDF) of convergence and predicted convergence speed for different values material params, grid nodes and smoothing steps. 

## Adjusting parameters

- Edit `run_convergence_tester.sh` for adjusting material params, smoothing steps and iterations.
