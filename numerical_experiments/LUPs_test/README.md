# LUPs_test â€” Numerical Speed Experiments

This folder contains scripts to benchmark the speed (Lattice Updates Per Second) of the elastostatic lattice-Boltzmann solver under different conditions.

## How to run the experiments

1. **Requirements**:  
   - Python 3 with required packages (see your project environment).

2. **Run the study**:  
   Open a terminal in this folder and execute:
   ```bash
   bash run_speed_study.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Run `speed_tester.py` for various grid sizes, precisions, and boundary conditions.
   - Repeat measurements for statistical reliability.
   - Log all output to a timestamped log file and results CSV.

3. **Outputs**:  
   - `log_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt`: Detailed log of all runs.
   - `results_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv`: Aggregated timing results.
   - Plots generated by `plotter.py` from the results CSV.

4. **Adjusting parameters**:  
   - Edit `run_speed_study.sh` to change grid sizes, time steps, number of iterations, or repetitions.
   - Edit `speed_tester.py` for low-level timing or solver options.
   - Edit `plotter.py` to change plotting behavior.

5. **Cleanup**:  
   Temporary files (`tmp_*`) are removed automatically after the script finishes.

## Notes

- All results are written to the directory where you run the script.
- For reproducibility, use the same Python environment and keep the generated log and CSV files.
